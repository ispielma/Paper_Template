# Source files for figures

All source material for figures go in subfolders here, including art files, python scripts, and data.

In this template we have an example directory for `Fig_Setup` this is nice because it indicates the content of the figures.  This makes for less work when it comes time to reorder the figures in LaTeX.

Currently the matplotlibrc file is setup to make reasonable looking physical review style figures.  A future goal is to replace that with a script that is styled for other journals as well.
