# Spielman group papers

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

This is a template for starting papers in the Spielman group that has standardized places for all the files to go.  The idea is to clone this into your project's new repo and then link to overleaf or edit on your local machine.  You should consider the workflow of writing a paper no differently from software and take advantage of revision control.  This implies that we should not maintain old versions documents, figures, or whatever.  Instead to get those, we just revert to a past version of the repository on our local machines.

Notice that the figure files go in the root directory.  This is because Physical Review journals currently do not allow directories in their submission (but arxiv does), so conforming to this standard here will make submission easier.
